<p>&nbsp;In the legal world, the growing area of cyber-crime, metadata and privacy laws all affirm the idea that technological change is inescapable. The implementation of video conferencing technologies in courts reflect an attempt by the judiciary to give effect to case-management principles and the overriding purpose - that is, the &#39;just, quick and cheap&#39; resolution of a dispute. Author Amy Salyzyn1 outlines&nbsp; the benefits of video conferencing in civil trials, but questions whether such benefits outweigh risks as identified.</p>

<p>Despite video conferencing generally reducing costs and is generally quicker than in-person examinations, the pursuit of such technologies should only be engaged with as a last resort for the purpose of upholding the integrity of the law in the Australian context. The paper will ascertain the current stance of Australian courts considering the issue of access to justice in light of Salyzyn&#39;s arguments, particularly the latter. Part three will examine the role of video conferencing in breaking down traditional social barriers before investigating and evaluating the cost and quality of video conferencing by considering the issue of credibility assessments and emotional connection and finally, part five will examine the impact of video conferencing on the public perception of the legal system.</p>
