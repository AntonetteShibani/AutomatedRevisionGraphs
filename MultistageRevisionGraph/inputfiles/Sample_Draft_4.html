<p>&nbsp;In the legal world, the growing area of cyber-crime, metadata and privacy laws all affirm the idea that technological change is inescapable. The implementation of video conferencing technologies in courts reflect an attempt by the judiciary to give effect to case-management principles and the overriding purpose - that is, the &#39;just, quick and cheap&#39; resolution of a dispute. Author Amy Salyzyn1 outlines&nbsp; the benefits of video conferencing in civil trials, but questions whether such benefits outweigh risks as identified.</p>

<p>Despite video conferencing generally reducing costs and is generally quicker than in-person examinations, the pursuit of technologies should enhance the integrity of the law in applying a just resolution to proceedings. This paper will ascertain the current stance of Australian courts considering the issue of access to justice in light of Salyzyn&#39;s arguments, particularly the latter.</p>

<p>In Part 1 of this paper, the current stance of Australian Courts in relation to how and when technology is utilised will be examined. It&nbsp;will examine the impact technology has on the requirements of a just, quick and cheap resolution of the proceedings, whilst considering the impacts technology may have on vulnerable witnesses.</p>

<p>Part five of this paper will examine the impact of video conferencing on the public perception of the legal system.</p>
