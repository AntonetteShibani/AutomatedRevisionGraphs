Described in the research article: Antonette Shibani (2020) Constructing Automated Revision Graphs: A novel visualization technique to study student writing. In Proceedings of the 21th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education.
Contains Jupyter notebooks for generating two forms of ARG (run in Python >3.5)
